function [lzc] = LZC(x)
% LZC calculates the Lempel-Ziv complexity of a non-binary signal by first binarizing it according
% to its median, then applying the LZ algorithm, and finally normalizing by its length.
% Adapted from the wikipedia page by Yasir Ã‡atal aka Duodenum
% Set parameters
n = length(x);
b = n/log2(n);
threshold = median(x);

% Binary series of 'ones' (higher values than median) and 'zeros' (lower values than median) 
bin = x; % Initialize binarized vector
bin(x >= threshold) = 1;
bin(x < threshold) = 0;

% for j = 1:n
%     if x(j) >= threshold
%    	    x(j) = 1;
% 	else
%    	    x(j) = 0;
