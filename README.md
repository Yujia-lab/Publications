## Subfolders description
Each paper's directory contains the following subfolders and files:

main_program: The primary analysis pipeline for the paper.

Figures: Visualizations and figures used in the paper.

Subfunctions: Utility functions for statistical analyses, specific calculations, and other supporting tasks.

## Note
These scripts are intended for academic replication rather than as a polished toolbox. They were written when Yujia was still a beginner in coding, so they may not be the easiest to read (apologies in advance!).

Additionally, some scripts were used for data exploration but were not included in the final publications.
